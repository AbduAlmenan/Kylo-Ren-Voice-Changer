# Kylo Ren Voice Changer for Android
Ever wanted to sound exactly like the dark lord, Kylo Ren? Well, that's.. umm.. weird. But if you've ever wanted to know how to add audio
effects to your Android audio effects, then here you go. All you need to do now is see the source code. Most of the algorithms and useful code is in the VoiceChangerFragment.java and PostRecordingActivity.java files. Experiement a little. This app isn't on the Google Play Store because, well, it impersonates Kylo Ren's character (owned by Disney, ugh). But you can obviously download it and play around a little. The APK file or the app file is called 'Emo Kylo Ren.apk' and to install the app, all you need to do is download this file and open it on your Android powered device. It's a lot of fun at parties, but don't trust me, try it out for yourself.

# Description

This is not your ordinary voice changer. The force is strong with this one. The dark side has seduced it. It wears black robes, wields a fiery light saber, and best of all, is like nothing you've ever heard before. Kylo Ren, the dark lord under Supreme Leader Snoke, and leader of the First Order, is here.

We all loved the way he sounds. Quite like Vader, and yet very different. The app uses powerful technology to combine, and morph your plain voice to sound almost exactly like Kylo's. You even have the option to increase and decrease the depth of your voice! Another great feature, is that you can actually add epic fan made background music to your impressions of Kylo Ren.

Features:

1. Adjust depth of Kylo's voice
2. Add epic background music
3. Share to various other apps on your device
4. Interact with #kylorenapp and #kyloren's fans on Twitter
5. Say the Tweet with direct streaming from the hugely popular twitter account of @KyloR3n

And of course, since this is a fun app, that's meant to poke fun at Kylo Ren's idiosyncracies, and non-commercial, it is completely ad-free.

I hope you have as much fun using this app, as I had coding it. Tweet to me @advait1911.
